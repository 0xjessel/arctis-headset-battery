**Elgato Stream Deck Plugin: Arctis Headset Battery Monitor**

### Overview

This plugin will display the battery level of an Arctis wireless headset on an Elgato Stream Deck key. It will poll for the battery status every 15 seconds (configurable) and support the following battery states:

- **Battery Levels:** 0-100%
- **Disconnected State:** Detect when the headset is not connected

### UI Design

- **Primary Icon:** Headphone icon
- **Battery Percentage:** Centered text below the icon

### Data Source

Fetching battery state is non-trivial and requires reverse engineering similar projects. The following GitHub repositories provide insight into how to extract battery status:

1. [Arctis Battery Windows App](https://github.com/craigster1991/arctis-battery-win-app)
2. [Arctis OLED Battery Indicator](https://github.com/EranVazana/Arctis-OLED-Battery-Indicator)
3. [Arctis Battery Indicator](https://github.com/aarol/arctis-battery-indicator)
4. [Arctis Battery Percentage](https://github.com/YourM4jesty/ArctisBatteryPercentage)
5. [Arctis USB Finder](https://github.com/richrace/arctis-usb-finder)

Based on [this blog post](https://aarol.dev/posts/arctis-hid/), the battery status is limited to four levels (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and includes disconnection detection.

**Important Note on Discrepancies with Referenced Blog Post:**
While the blog post at [aarol.dev](https://aarol.dev/posts/arctis-hid/) provided valuable insights, our testing revealed significant differences between the described behavior and our observations with the Arctis 7 2019 model:

1. The blog post describes using command bytes `[0x00, 0xb0]` for the Arctis Nova 7, while our implementation uses `[0x06, 0x18]` for the Arctis 7 2019.

2. According to the blog, "the charging status will be `0` when not connected, `1` when charging and `3` when discharging." However, our testing with the Arctis 7 2019 showed inconsistent values in byte 3 that did not follow this pattern.

3. The blog mentions that "the headset only sends the battery status in the range [0-4], with 4 being 100% charge," whereas our Arctis 7 2019 reports battery levels from 0-100 directly.

4. Our response data showed values in byte 3 (such as 65 or 0x65) that don't match any of the expected values mentioned in the blog post.

These discrepancies highlight the differences between headset models and underscore why we couldn't reliably determine charging status for our specific model.

### Technical Findings: USB HID Communication Protocol

After extensive testing and reverse engineering, we've documented the following details about communicating with SteelSeries Arctis headsets:

#### Device Identification

- **Finding the Correct Interface:**

  - Not all HID interfaces on the headset support battery status reading
  - The correct interface has specific characteristics:
    - Usage: `514`
    - UsagePage: `65347`
  - This has been verified for the Arctis 7 (2019) model
  - Other models may use different interface parameters

- **Device Enumeration:**
  - Multiple interfaces may be present for the same physical device
  - The headset typically presents 2-3 interfaces with the same VendorID/ProductID
  - Only one interface supports battery status commands

#### Communication Protocol

- **Command Structure:**

  - Battery status is requested by sending a specific command: `[0x06, 0x18]`
  - The command must be written to the device using the HID write method
  - A timeout of 1000ms is recommended when reading the response

- **Response Format:**

  - The headset returns a multi-byte response
  - The basic response format is:
    - Bytes 0-1: Echo of the command (`0x06, 0x18`)
    - Byte 2: Battery level (0-100, sometimes >100)
    - Remaining bytes: Various status information that varies between models and firmware versions

#### Battery Level Interpretation

- **Raw Value:**

  - Battery level is reported in byte 2 of the response
  - The value typically ranges from 0-100, representing percentage
  - In some cases, the value can exceed 100% (we've observed values up to 105%)
  - For consistency, we cap the reported value at 100%

- **Accuracy:**

  - The battery level appears to be reported in increments of 1%
  - This is more granular than the 25% increments mentioned in some documentation
  - The Stream Deck UI can be designed to show precise percentages

- **Testing Limitations:**
  - Our testing has primarily been conducted with the headset at or near 100% battery level
  - We haven't yet verified how the battery level is reported across the entire range (0-100%)
  - It's possible that the Arctis 7 2019 might use a different scale (such as the 0-4 range mentioned in the blog post for the Arctis Nova 7) when the battery is at lower levels
  - Further testing with partially discharged batteries would be needed to confirm the full behavior of the battery level reporting

**TODO**: Test the headset at various battery levels (75%, 50%, 25%, near empty) to verify whether the Arctis 7 2019 reports battery levels as 0-100 values or uses a different scale. Update the implementation if necessary based on findings.

#### Charging Status Detection Issues

After extensive testing with the Arctis 7 2019 model, we've concluded that reliable charging status detection is not possible using the HID response alone. Here's what we found:

- **Inconsistent Response Patterns:**

  - The response bytes do not consistently indicate charging status in a way that matches expected patterns from other implementations
  - When testing with the headset in identical physical states (plugged in or unplugged), we observed different values in the response bytes

- **Failed Approaches:**

  - We attempted to use byte 3 as a charging indicator (as suggested by some implementations)
  - We also tried byte 4 as an alternative charging indicator
  - We looked for patterns in other bytes (checking for values of 0, 1, or 3)
  - None of these approaches provided consistent results across multiple tests

- **Test Results:**

  - Test 1: Headset plugged in and turned on - inconsistent charging indicators
  - Test 2: Headset not plugged in but turned on - inconsistent charging indicators
  - Test 3: Repeat of Test 1 with same physical setup - different response values
  - Test 4: Headset turned off - consistent battery level of 0, but no reliable charging indicators

- **Alternative Solution - USB Device Detection:**

  - We discovered a reliable method to detect when the headset is charging via USB connected to the PC
  - When the Arctis 7 2019 headset is connected directly to the PC via USB for charging, additional USB devices appear with:
    - Product ID: `0x12ae`
    - Product Name: `SteelSeries Arctis 7 Bootloader`
    - Vendor ID: `0x1038`
  - By detecting the presence of these bootloader devices, we can determine if the headset is currently charging via the PC's USB port
  - Limitations:
    - This method only works when the headset is charging via the PC's USB port
    - It won't detect charging from other power sources (like wall adapters)
    - It requires the headset to be directly connected to the PC, not through a USB hub
  - Advantages:
    - This is more reliable than trying to interpret the HID response bytes
    - It provides a clear binary indication (charging/not charging) without ambiguity
    - It works regardless of whether the headset is turned on or off

- **Conclusion:**
  - For the Arctis 7 2019 model, charging status cannot be reliably determined from the HID response
  - The USB device detection method provides a partial solution for detecting charging via PC USB
  - For charging from other power sources, external methods (such as user input or monitoring battery level changes over time) would be needed

#### Implementation Considerations

- **Error Handling:**

  - Connection to the headset can fail for various reasons
  - Timeouts should be implemented for all read operations
  - The code should gracefully handle disconnection events

- **Polling Frequency:**

  - Battery level changes slowly, but users may want more frequent updates
  - A 15-second polling interval provides good balance of responsiveness and resource usage
  - More frequent polling may impact battery life of the headset
  - Users can configure polling from 5-60 seconds based on their needs

- **Device Reconnection:**
  - The code should attempt to reconnect if the headset becomes unavailable
  - This is particularly important for wireless headsets that may temporarily disconnect

#### Cross-Validation

- **Comparison with Other Implementations:**
  - Our implementation has been cross-validated with other open-source projects
  - The command structure (`[0x06, 0x18]`) is consistent across implementations
  - The interpretation of byte 2 as battery level is consistent
  - The charging status interpretation varies between implementations, likely due to inconsistencies in the headset's response

#### Model-Specific Considerations

- **Arctis 7 (2019) - Verified:**

  - Product ID: `0x12ad`
  - Vendor ID: `0x1038`
  - Correct interface has Usage: `514` and UsagePage: `65347`
  - Battery level reporting is reliable
  - Charging status detection is unreliable

- **Other Models:**
  - While our code supports other models (Arctis 7 2017, Arctis Pro, Arctis 1 Wireless)
  - These have not been verified and may have different response formats
  - Additional testing is needed to confirm behavior across all models

This comprehensive understanding of the USB HID protocol for SteelSeries Arctis headsets enables reliable battery monitoring, which forms the foundation of our Stream Deck plugin.

### Implementation Learnings

#### Porting Challenges from `read-battery.ts` to `battery-level.ts`

During the implementation of the Stream Deck plugin, we encountered several challenges when porting the working code from the standalone script (`read-battery.ts`) to the plugin action (`battery-level.ts`):

1. **ES Modules vs CommonJS**

   - The Stream Deck SDK uses ES modules, while `node-hid` is a CommonJS module
   - Solution: Used `createRequire` from `module` to load `node-hid` in CommonJS mode
   - Required careful handling of `__dirname` and path resolution in ES modules context

2. **HID Device Initialization**

   - Early HID initialization testing was crucial to catch startup errors
   - Added comprehensive error logging for HID initialization failures
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when device connections fail

3. **Charging Detection Consistency**

   - Initially tried to port the charging detection logic directly
   - Discovered that using `HID.devices()` directly caused inconsistencies
   - Solution: Used the require'd version of `node-hid` consistently throughout the code
   - Maintained the bootloader device detection method from `read-battery.ts`

4. **Type Safety Challenges**

   - Stream Deck SDK required stricter type checking
   - Added proper type information for HID.Device parameters
   - Enhanced error handling with TypeScript-friendly error objects

5. **Logging Strategy**

   - Started with verbose logging from `read-battery.ts`
   - Refined to keep only essential logs for production use
   - Focused on critical events: initialization, connection, battery status, and errors
   - Removed verbose device enumeration and raw data logs

6. **State Management**

   - Added proper cleanup of device connections on action disappear
   - Implemented careful handling of device reconnection scenarios
   - Maintained consistent UI updates based on connection state

7. **Error Recovery**
   - Enhanced error handling for device connection failures
   - Added automatic retry logic for device enumeration
   - Improved user feedback through Stream Deck UI alerts

These learnings helped create a more robust and maintainable implementation while preserving the core functionality of the original script.

### Project Milestones

(Agent should check in with the user at each milestone for feedback and progress confirmation.)

1. **Create a function that can connect to the SteelSeries headset and extract the battery %.**

2. **Create a dummy Stream Deck action** ([reference](https://docs.elgato.com/streamdeck/sdk/guides/actions)) with a text input for the battery %.

3. **Connect the function logic to the action UI** to dynamically update the display with real-time battery data.

### Expected Deliverables

- Stream Deck plugin (.sdPlugin)
- Configuration UI for polling interval and selecting which headset to monitor
- Clear, efficient, and well-documented code
- Proper error handling for disconnected states

This spec provides all necessary details for the AI-code editor to build the plugin effectively.
