# SteelSeries Arctis 7 (2019) Battery Level Testing Log

This file records raw HID response bytes and battery level readings from the SteelSeries Arctis 7 (2019) headset under different conditions. The goal is to verify our reverse engineering of the battery level reporting protocol.

## Test Format

- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the test
- **Raw Response**: Full byte array from the headset
- **Battery Level**: Interpreted battery level from byte 2
- **Charging Status**: Whether the headset is plugged into USB
- **Power State**: Whether the headset is turned on/off
- **Notes**: Any additional observations

## Test Log

### Test 1

- **Timestamp**: 2024-03-19 15:45 UTC
- **Raw Response**: `[06 18 5a 4d 26 74 05 bf 4c 22 3b 11 38 0e 54 2a 05 44 1a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]`
- **Battery Level**: 90% (0x5a)
- **Charging Status**: Not charging (no bootloader devices detected)
- **Power State**: On
- **Notes**:
  - First two bytes (0x06, 0x18) match our command echo
  - Battery level in byte 2 (0x5a = 90) appears to directly represent percentage
  - Byte 3 is 0x4d (77), which doesn't match the expected charging indicator pattern from other implementations
  - Multiple non-zero bytes after the battery level, but their purpose is currently unknown
