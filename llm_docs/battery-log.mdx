# SteelSeries Arctis 7 (2019) Battery Level Testing Log

This file records raw HID response bytes and battery level readings from the SteelSeries Arctis 7 (2019) headset under different conditions. The goal is to verify our reverse engineering of the battery level reporting protocol.

## Test Format

- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the test
- **Raw Response**: Full byte array from the headset
- **Battery Level**: Interpreted battery level from byte 2
- **Charging Status**: Whether the headset is plugged into USB
- **Power State**: Whether the headset is turned on/off
- **Notes**: Any additional observations

## Test Log

### Test 1

- **Timestamp**: 2024-03-19 15:45 UTC
- **Raw Response**: `[06 18 5a 4d 26 74 05 bf 4c 22 3b 11 38 0e 54 2a 05 44 1a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]`
- **Battery Level**: 90% (0x5a)
- **Charging Status**: Not charging (no bootloader devices detected)
- **Power State**: On
- **Notes**:
  - First two bytes (0x06, 0x18) match our command echo
  - Battery level in byte 2 (0x5a = 90) appears to directly represent percentage
  - Byte 3 is 0x4d (77), which doesn't match the expected charging indicator pattern from other implementations
  - Multiple non-zero bytes after the battery level, but their purpose is currently unknown

### Test 2

- **Timestamp**: 2024-03-19 16:30 UTC
- **Raw Response**: `[06 18 60 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]`
- **Battery Level**: 96% (0x60)
- **Charging Status**: Not charging (no bootloader devices detected)
- **Power State**: On
- **Notes**:
  - First two bytes (0x06, 0x18) match our command echo
  - Battery level in byte 2 (0x60 = 96) continues to directly represent percentage
  - Byte 3 and all subsequent bytes are 0x00, which is different from Test 1
  - This test shows a simpler response pattern with zeros after the battery level
  - The difference in response patterns between Test 1 and 2 suggests that the additional bytes may be related to other headset states or may be non-deterministic
  - Three interfaces were detected:
    1. Usage: 1, UsagePage: 12
    2. Usage: 514, UsagePage: 65347 (this is our target interface)
    3. Usage: 1, UsagePage: 65280
  - The headset was plugged in via USB for a few minutes before this test, then unplugged for the test
  - The higher battery level (96% vs 90% in Test 1) suggests successful charging between tests

### Test 3

- **Timestamp**: 2024-03-20 (current date)
- **Raw Response**: `[06 18 54 57 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]`
- **Battery Level**: 84% (0x54)
- **Charging Status**: Not charging (no bootloader devices detected)
- **Power State**: On
- **Notes**:
  - First two bytes (0x06, 0x18) match our command echo
  - Battery level in byte 2 (0x54 = 84) continues to directly represent percentage
  - Byte 3 is 0x57 (87), which is non-zero unlike Test 2 but different from Test 1
  - All bytes after byte 3 are 0x00
  - Three interfaces were detected:
    1. Usage: 1, UsagePage: 12
    2. Usage: 514, UsagePage: 65347 (this is our target interface)
    3. Usage: 1, UsagePage: 65280
  - The battery level has decreased from previous tests (84% vs 96% in Test 2), which further confirms that byte 2 represents battery percentage
  - The non-zero value in byte 3 (0x57) differs from both previous tests, suggesting this byte may contain other status information not directly related to battery level
  - The headset was used for about an hour between Test 2 and Test 3, which explains the battery level decrease from 96% to 84%
